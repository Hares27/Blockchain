Virtual machines are isolated environments. The main purpose of virtual machine is to get same output for specific input in any environment. I can consider virtual machine are functions which takes input and gives output which is same for who ever run the this function with same input. In Blockchain virtual machines plays a main role to make validators come to consensus.The Blockchain does not create virtual machine for normal transaction like transfering money.Blockchain create virtual machine for transaction who need to interact with contract to transafer an asset.
